### Life is short
- When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit."
- But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.
- Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.
